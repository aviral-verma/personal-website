    <p><strong>Hey Folks!</strong>
Let’s talk about the frontend web development first. Frontend refers to the development of user interface( in layman’s language: development of that part of a website which you directly see whenever you visit it).</p>

<p>Start learning HTML&gt;CSS&gt;JavaScript in this order.
There are various sites to learn these. You can go to W3Schools Online Web Tutorials and try to get familiar with the basics of HTML and then CSS. Or if you love video tutorials then Video Tutorials on Programming and More or Codecademy - learn to code, interactively, for free would be a great choice!
So you started learning HTML first. Don’t just read the code. From Day-1 of your learning, start making a webpage of your own and implement/experiment on it all the code you learn.
Now your webpage seems very boring right. You want it to look good, don’t you? So now start learning basic CSS and implement this also in your webpage. It will make it look good(atleast better than before :P)
Don’t try to go very deep into the HTML and CSS. Just get familiar with how the things work. You can always refer the syntax whenever you are building a website. So don’t waste your time here. You should learn how to google(the most important skill, not joking!).
I’ll suggest download some pre-made templates of some websites. Go to its code and try to read, edit and experiment on it. The code is given in the “index.html” file. This way you will learn faster, really very faster!
When you are comfortable working with HTML and CSS, then comes the time to learn how to program your webpage or to make it interactive. This can be done by using “JavaScript”.
For learning JavaScript either go to Codecademy - learn to code, interactively, for free or go through a wonderful book “Head First JavaScript”. For JavaScript refer Aviral Verma’s answer to What is the best way to learn JavaScript?
JavaScript is used for both frontend and backend web development. So it’s really useful to learn it.
If you are loving frontend web development then go thorough “Bootstrap” also. It’s an awesome framework of HTML, CSS and JavaScript combined. Go to some templates made in Bootstrap and start reading, editing it’s code(the fastest way to learn Bootstrap in my opinion).
You can host your website on GitHub pages(personal choice). You don’t even have to worry about domain name here, GitHub will provide that.Let me know through comments if you want a further explanation about using GitHub pages.
If you want to further add amazing animations to your website, learn about jquery(a JavaScript library). Want to see how it works? Have a look at my IITK homepage which I made during my initial days at IIT Kanpur using Bootstrap. The animations are done by using jquery plugins. Visit Aviral Verma’s homepage
For backend web development you can master JavaScript, python etc.</p>
